        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This heavenly-smelling bread is soft and chewy on the inside with 
            a crisp, cruchy exterior. For the best flavor and texture, let the 
            dough rest in the fridge overnight.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups <strong>warm water</strong> 100-110°F</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons <strong>active dry yeast</strong></li>
            <li>1/4 cup <strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <strong>kosher salt</strong></li>
            <li>4 1/2-5 cups <strong>all purpose flour</strong> or <strong>bread flour</strong> plus more for hands</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Topping and Pan</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 tablespoons <strong>extra virgin oilve oil</strong></li>
            <li>2 <strong>garlic cloves</strong> minced</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons chopped fresh <strong>basil, thyme, </strong>and <strong>rosemary</strong></li>
            <li>sprinkle of <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a spatula to mix together 1 cup of the warm water, 2 teaspoons sugar, 
                and 2 teaspoons yeast together in a bowl. Cover and let dough rest for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the remaining water, oliver oil, salt, and 1 cup flour. Beat for 20 seconds, 
                then add 3 1/2 cups more flour. Beat for 2 minutes. If the dough is still sticking
                to the sides of the bowl, add the last 1/2 cup of flour.
            </li>
            <li>Knead dough for 5 minutes on lightly floured surface. If the dough becomes too 
                sticky durning kneading, sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour at a time on dough. Do 
                <strong>NOT</strong> add more flour than needed, you don't want a dry dough.
            </li>
            <li>The dough should still feel a little soft when kneading is done.
                Poke dough with your finger; if it bounces back, it's ready to rise. You can also
                Tear off a golfball sized piece from your dough, stretch it until light passes through,
                and hold it up to a window. If the light passes through the dough without it tearing
                it's ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes this test.
            </li>
            <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with a tablespoon of oil or nonstick spray. 
                You can use the same bowl that was used for the dough. Place the dough in the 
                bowl and turn it to coat all side with the oil. Cover bowl with aliminum foil, 
                plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature 
                for 2-3 hours or until double in size.
            </li>
            <li>Generously grease a 12x17-inch baking pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. This 
                is the base layer of the bread.
            </li>
            <li>When the dough is ready, puch it down to release air bubbles. Place in the 
                oiled baking pan, then stretch and flatten the dough to fit the pan. 
                <strong>Don't tear the dough.</strong> If your dough is shrinking, cover with 
                a clean towel and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before continuing.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the dough tightly and let it rest in the fridge for at least 
                1 hour and up to 24 hours. The longer it rests the better the flavor.
                At least 12 hours (overnight) is recommended.
            </li>
            <li>Remove dough from fridge and let sit at room temperature while you 
                preheat the oven and prepare your toppings. <strong>Keep it covered.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F and allow to heat for at least 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk 3 remaining tablespoons of olive oil with minced gralic, rosemary, and 
                thyme. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Using your fingers, dimple the dough all over the surface. Drizzle the 
                olive oil topping and use your hands or a patry brush to spread all over 
                the top. Add a little more olive oil if needed so the dough is completely 
                covered. Sprinkle with coarse salt and ground black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for 20-23 minutes or until lightly browned on top. If desired, broil 
                on high for last minute to really brown top.
            </li>
            <li>Cut and serve. Enjoy!</li>
